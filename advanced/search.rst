Advanced Search
===============

With Zammad, you can limit your search to specific attributes.
This allows you to find e.g. tickets with specific key words and states.
Below information will help you to improve your search results.

For instance you can search for a specific customer
by using ``customer.attribute``::

   customer.firstname: John

or::

   customer.lastname: Doe


If you want to run a more complex search, you can use conditions
with ``()`` and ``AND``/``OR`` options::

   state.name: open AND (article.from:me OR article.from:somebody)

Available attributes

   "state.name", "new |br|\ open |br|\ closed", "state.name: new |br|\ state.name:new OR open", "You can filter for specific ticket states (and even combine them with an OR).

Zammad will also allow you to use regular expressions, where ever the attributes allows it."

Combining search phrases
------------------------

You can combine search phrases by using ``AND``, ``OR`` and ``TO``,
depending on the situation and phrases you use. If needed, you can parts of
your search phrase for complex searches with ``()``. This allows you to
combine several phrases with different dependencies (AND/OR). In case you
receive search results that you want to exclude, you can use negation ``!``.
Below are some examples that you could use with this:

   :widths: 10, 20

   "state.name:(closed OR open) AND (priority.name:""2 normal"" OR tags:feedback)", "Show every ticket that state is either closed or open and has priority normal or the tag feedback."
   "state.name:(closed OR open) AND (priority.name:""2 normal"" OR tags:feedback) AND !(*Zammad*)", "This gets the same result as above, expect that we don't want the ticket to contain anything matching to ""Zammad"""
   "owner.email:bob@example.net AND state.name:(open OR new)", "Show Tickets from bob@example.net that are either open or new"
   "state.name:pending* AND article_count:[1 TO 5]", "Show everything with any pending state and an article count of 1 to 5."
