Working with Text Modules
=========================

Zammad offers so-called text modules.
Text modules will help you to improve your workflow, as you don't have to type
your answer on every ticket by hand. You can simply choose a fitting text
module and insert it into the e-mail.

To access available text modules, simply type ``::`` within an article body.
If you found the right text module, just press enter or click with your left
mouse and Zammad will insert the modules Text at the place your cursor is.

You can either scroll through all modules (mouse or direction keys), type the
module name or enter a keyword (if keywords are set).

Text Modules Missing?
---------------------

You noticed that some text modules don't always appear?

Text modules can be tied to **groups**: that is, they only become active
once the ticket you're working on has been assigned to the appropriate
group.

   Text modules are updated immediately when a new group has been
   selectedâ€”no need to click **Update**.

How do you know which groups go with which text modules? Ask your administrator!

Text Modules on Ticket Creation
-------------------------------

You can use text modules on ticket creation as well. On ticket creation,
our :ref:`ticket_templates` might get handy too.

Customizing Text Modules

Administrators can learn more about customizing text modules
