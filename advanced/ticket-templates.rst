Ticket Templates
================

If you find yourself creating lots of tickets with the same basic attributes,
use **ticket templates** to fill them in with a single click next time.

   :align: center

   Use the ticket pane to load ticket templates.

On any *new ticket* dialogue use the üóíÔ∏è tab on the right to display the
*Templates* column. If Zammad has any templates for you to apply, you'll
be provided with a drop down list to choose from.

Select a fitting template and press *Apply*.
The configured ticket fields will be populated with the data from the template.

Field collisions
   Starting with version 5.3, Zammad is able to detect "field collisions".
   This means: If you previously filled in data in a field that's supposed to be
   filled by the template, Zammad *will not* overwrite the field with the
   template data.

   Instead it will keep your version of the field.
   This allows you to e.g. fill in the customer before applying the template. üéâ

Can't add or adjust templates?
   Managing templates requires additional permissions.
   Please ask your administrator to provide you with the needed permission.

   :admin-docs:`in the admin documentation </manage/templates.html>`.

   This permission was introduced with Zammad 5.3.

   .. These version notes will be removed on later documentation versions.
