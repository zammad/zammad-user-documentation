Merging Tickets
===============

Sometimes, you may end up with two tickets for the same issue
(*e.g.,* because a customer sent you a brand new email
instead of replying to an existing thread).

In such cases, you may want to **merge those tickets into one**.

   To merge a ticket, access the **Ticket â–¾** submenu in the ticket pane.

.. note:: Merging a ticket migrates all messages and notes
   **out of the original** and into the selected one.

   That is, if you 1) access the merge dialog from Ticket A, and then
   2) select Ticket B in the merge dialog (see below),
   then Ticket A will be emptied, closed,
   and :doc:`linked as a child <link>` of Ticket B.

   The merge dialog. Specify a ticket to merge into by ID (1),
   or select one from the list (2).
