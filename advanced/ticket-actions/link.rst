Linking Tickets
===============

When tickets about related issues arise, they can be linked to each other for
easier reference. For example this could be useful if you have multiple
customer complaints about the same shipment. Additionally, merged and split
articles are automatically linked.

Link types
   There are different types of links between tickets as you might have already
   seen in :doc:`merge` or :doc:`split`: parent/child links and normal
   links. The first pair is used for split and merged tickets. The normal link
   is useful when there is no logical hierarchy between tickets.

   However, if you have a main issue and want to create sub tasks, you could
   link to the main one as a parent of the sub tickets.

How to link
   Make sure to have the ticket side panel open. Under the "Tags" section you
   can find the "Links" section:

   .. figure:: /images/advanced/ticket-actions/link.png
      :alt: Ticket pane: Links
      :align: center

   Click the *➕ Add Link* button to access the link dialog.

Link dialog
   You can enter the ticket number of the ticket you want to link to
   (see 1).
   Alternatively, you can choose from the list below (see 2).

   If the customer has an existing ticket, it will show up under "Recent
   customer tickets". You can see your last viewed tickets under "Recently
   viewed tickets" anyway.

   Additionally, you can choose the link type from the drop down menu. You can
   link to one or more tickets for each type.

   After entering a ticket number or choosing one of the offered tickets from
   the list, click on the submit button and the tickets will be linked.
