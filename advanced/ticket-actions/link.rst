Linking Tickets
===============

When tickets about related issues arise
(*e.g.,* multiple customer complaints about the same botched shipment),
they can be **linked to each other** for easier reference.

   Click the *âž• Add Link* button to access the link dialog.

   The link dialog. Specify a ticket to link with by ID (1),
   or select one from the list (2).

.. tip:: Linked tickets may optionally be organized into a parent-child hierarchy.
