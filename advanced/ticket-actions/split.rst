Splitting Tickets
=================

If you have a ticket which is about more than one issue, you might want
to split it in two or more separate tickets. For example this might be the case
if a customer has a technical question and wants to place an order.

To split a ticket, simply click on the "split" button under the article you
want to split off:

   :alt: Split ticket button
   :align: center

After clicking on the "split" button, a dialog for creating a new ticket is
presented to you:

   :align: center
   :scale: 90%

It is prefilled with the content of the existing article. Remember to select
the type (call/email).

The original ticket is :doc:`linked <link>` to the new one, as you can see in
the ticket side panel:
