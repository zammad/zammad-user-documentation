Splitting Tickets
=================

Some tickets may actually encompass more than one issue,
or require attention separately from two different departments
(*e.g.,* sales and customer service).

In such cases, you can **split off a single message into its own ticket**.
(Alternately, it may make more sense to
:ref:`simply take turns on a single ticket <sharing-work>` instead.)

   Click the “split” button to take a message and use it as the starting point
   for a new ticket.

   When splitting a ticket, the target message is imported into the new ticket
   dialog. As usual, remember to select the **type** (call/email).

   The original ticket is :doc:`linked <link>` to the new one, as seen in the
   ticket pane.
