Time Accounting
===============

Zammad supports detailed time accounting to help administrators keep track of
how much time you spend on any given ticket, customer or client organization.

If the time accounting is enabled, this dialog will appear each time you update
a ticket. Enter how much time you spent on it.

.. note:: **🤔 Huh? I don’t see a “Time Accounting” dialog...** 

   This feature is **optional**; if you don’t see it whenever you update a
   ticket, that means your administrator hasn’t enabled it yet.
   Administrators can learn more
   :admin-docs:`here <manage/time-accounting.html>`.

.. hint:: **In which unit is the accounted time recorded?**

   The Accounted time is always recorded as unitless numbers. However, your
   administrator may decide to show an optional label next to the field to hint
   you and your colleagues which unit is assumed.

.. hint:: **What is an Activity Type?**

   **Activity Types** are used for grouping accounted time entries together.
   This is an **optional** feature which shows a list of activities as a
   selectable list.

   Simply choose the closest type of the activity you are recording the time
   for, noting that one of the choices may be pre-selected. You can always
   remove the selection for general accounted time that is not supposed to be
   grouped together.
