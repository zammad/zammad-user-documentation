The article editor is a rich text editor. This means you can:

- Copy and paste (or drag and drop) formatted text, images and file attachments.
- Apply formatting by using the built-in
  :doc:`keyboard shortcuts </advanced/keyboard-shortcuts>` or by selecting
  text and choose from the formatting options in the bubble menu. This menu
  automatically appears when selecting text and looks like this:

    :alt: Screenshot shows editor bubble menu to format text.
- Use :doc:`text modules </advanced/text-modules>` by typing :kbd:`:` :kbd:`:`
  which can be a huge time saver.
- :ref:`Mention colleagues <mentions>` by typing :kbd:`@` :kbd:`@` followed by
  their name to ask a question or notify them.
