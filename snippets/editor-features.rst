The article editor is a rich text editor. This means you can:

- Copy and paste (or drag and drop) formatted text, images and file attachments.
- Apply formatting by using the built-in
  :doc:`keyboard shortcuts </advanced/keyboard-shortcuts>` or by selecting
  text choose from formatting options in the bubble menu. This menu
  automatically appears when selecting text.
