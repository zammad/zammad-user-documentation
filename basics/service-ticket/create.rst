Creating a Ticket
=================

Zammad does its best to create tickets automatically
when new customer issues come your way.
But sometimes,
there's just no way for Zammad to know when an issue arrives ‚Äì
like when a customer calls on the phone.

In these cases, Zammad needs your help to **create a new ticket**.

   Click the **‚ûï button** to create a new ticket. The default ticket type is
   **Received Call**.

An agent can create three types of tickets:

:Received Call: for issues **initiated by a customer** over the phone.
:Outbound Call: for issues **initiated by an agent** over the phone.
:Send Email:    for issues **initiated by an agent** over email.

Filling Out the Form
--------------------

Here's a quick run-down of each input field in the New Ticket form:

Title
   The title of the ticket will be used as the **subject line**
   for all email correspondences.

Customer
   Enter a name or email address of a customer to search. You can even search
   for organizations and their members. Select an option from the autocomplete
   menu or create a new customer by clicking the "‚ûï Create new Customer"
   button. A ticket may only have **one** customer.

   Once a customer has been selected,
   her profile will be accessible from the **ticket pane**.

Text
   üìû For phone calls, record the details of your conversation.
   These notes will not be sent to the customer
   (though he may be able to see them if he has a Zammad account).

   üìß For emails, this is the body of your outgoing message.
