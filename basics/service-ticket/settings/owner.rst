Owner
=====

A ticket’s **owner** is simply
*the agent that is currently responsible for it*.

Whose job is it to assign tickets?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It depends on your organization’s workflow,
but in most cases,
**you will assign tickets to yourself**
when you choose an issue to work on
from the pool of new tickets.

In principle, any agent may assign a ticket to any other,
as long as both have the required privileges
for the ticket’s :doc:`group </basics/service-ticket/settings/group>`.

Why would I want to re-assign a ticket to someone else?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sometimes, complicated issues will require a ticket
to be :ref:`passed back and forth between multiple agents <sharing-work>`
before it can be closed.
In such cases,
a colleague may assign a ticket to you (or vice versa)
after it has been partially resolved.
