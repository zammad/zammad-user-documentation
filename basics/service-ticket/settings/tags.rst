**Tags** are custom-defined labels that can be applied to tickets
to make it easier to find them in the future.

   Click on a tag name to view other tickets with the same tag.

.. hint:: :doc:`Search for tickets with a given tag </basics/find-ticket/search>`

   For instance, find all tickets with the **order** tag
   by searching for ``tags: order``.
