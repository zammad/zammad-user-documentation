Work with Tickets
=================

Because the flow differs from creating or updating a ticket, the description is
split into different pages. Additionally, there is a third page about
ticket attributes which applies to ticket creation and ticket update.

- :doc:`Create tickets <work-with-tickets/create-tickets>`
- :doc:`Update tickets <work-with-tickets/update-tickets>`
- :doc:`Ticket attributes <work-with-tickets/attributes>`
