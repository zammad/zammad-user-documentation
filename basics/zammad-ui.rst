Zammad UI
=========

The user interface (UI) of Zammad is designed to provide an intuitive experience
for users. It is built around the concept of simplicity, clarity, and
accessibility and is based on common software design principles which should
make the UI pretty self explanatory.

There are basic modular components for different features to keep the UI
consistent. These components are described in the sections below.
Depending on the currently opened screen, there are interactive components, such
as tooltips and a contextual help. Use them wherever needed.

Overview
--------

The screenshot below shows the Zammad UI with the ticket detail view opened.
Read on for a description of the different main elements of Zammad.

Navigation sidebar (1)
   This is the left sidebar which includes the search, notifications, overviews,
   ticket tabs, your avatar and the ticket create button.

Navigation tab (2)
   Each item of the navigation sidebar is called navigation tab. Depending on
   the content, it can be a ticket tab (with the ticket detail view) or the
   overview tab which opens the list of available overviews.

Ticket detail view (3)
   This is where you handle your customer requests. It is located in the middle
   of the screen if a ticket tab is selected in the navigation sidebar.

Sidebar (4)
   This is the right sidebar in the ticket detail view. It contains sidebar tabs
   like customers and checklists and displays the currently selected tab.

Sidebar tabs (5)
   On the left side of the sidebar, you can find small icons to switch between
   the different tabs. The availability of these tabs depends on your system
   configuration, your permissions and the ticket attributes (e.g. if the
   customer of the ticket has an assigned organization).

Navigation Sidebar
------------------

The navigation sidebar displays different areas. You might not see all of them
because some depend on the configuration of your Zammad.
