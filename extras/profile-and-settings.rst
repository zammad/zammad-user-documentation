      By default, you will receive notifications for all tickets on every group
      you belong to—even for tickets that are assigned to other agents. Use the
      **Limit Groups** box to disable such notifications on a per-group basis.
      (You will continue to receive notifications for your own tickets.)

   .. hint:: The contents of these email notifications
      can be customized on self-hosted installations.
      Administrators can learn more
      `here <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/manage/trigger/system-notifications.html>`_.

:Out of Office: 

    Schedule out-of-office periods in advance, and designate a substitute to
    handle your tickets while you’re gone.
    
    Your substitute will receive all your ticket notifications during your
    absence, and have a custom :doc:`overview </basics/find-ticket/browse>`
    created to help keep track of your tickets.
	
    .. note:: 🔔 You **will** continue to receive notifications while you are
              out-of-office!

:Calendar:

   Add your ticket deadlines to your own favorite calendar app with the ICAL
   link listed at this settings panel.

:Devices:

   See a list of all devices logged in to your Zammad account (and revoke
   access, if necessary).

:Token Access:

   Generate personal access tokens for third-party applications to use the
   Zammad API.

   .. caution:: Always generate a new token for each application you connect to
                Zammad! (This makes it possible to revoke access one
                application at a time if a token is ever compromised.)

:Linked Accounts:

   See a list of third-party services (*e.g.,* Facebook or Twitter) linked to
   your Zammad account.
