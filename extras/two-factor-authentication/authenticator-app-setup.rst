Authenticator App Setup
=======================

The authenticator app method is a type of two-factor authentication that uses a
mobile application to generate one-time codes for account verification. After
setting up the authenticator app on your device, you will link it to your Zammad
account.

First, make sure you have installed an authenticator app on your mobile device.
Recommended apps are:

* `Google Authenticator <https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447>`_
* `Authy <https://support.authy.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001945848-Installing-Authy-apps/>`_
* `Microsoft Authenticator <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/account-billing/download-and-install-the-microsoft-authenticator-app-351498fc-850a-45da-b7b6-27e523b8702a>`_

Next, open the authenticator app on your device and find a **Scan QR Code**
action, or similar. Point your camera to the Zammad screen and scan the shown QR
code in the middle.

.. hint::
   If your device is not able to scan the QR code, first click on it to reveal
   your secret. Next, add a manual entry to your authenticator app and enter the
   provided secret when asked.

Your authenticator app should immediately add the new entry for your Zammad
account, and a 6-digit code will be displayed next to it together with a timer.

Back in Zammad, enter the provided code to the **Security Code** field and click
on **Set Up**.
