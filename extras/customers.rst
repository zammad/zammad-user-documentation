If the customer has other tickets too, you can see a summary when you
hover over the **open/closed** labels:

   other tickets.

Editing a Customer

Most customer attributes are self-explanatory,
but here are a couple that might confuse you:

:Organization:

   Customers may (optionally) belong to **organizations** –
   :doc:`skip ahead <organizations>` to learn more.

:Secondary Organizations:

   Unlike organizations, you can add several organizations here that are not
   as highlighted. Still, the same behavior applies.

:VIP:

   Like the ticket priority, the **VIP status** doesn't actually do anything
   out-of-the-box. But an admin *can* set up automation rules based on
   this value or use it as a filter for custom
   :ref:`overviews <overviews>`.

   **Ask your administrator** about how she'd like you to use this attribute
   (or just leave it alone).
