Most customer attributes are self-explanatory,
but here are a couple that might confuse you:

:Organization:

   Customers may (optionally) belong to **organizations** â€“
   :doc:`skip ahead <organizations>` to learn more.

:Secondary Organizations:

   Unlike organizations, you can add several organizations here that are not
   as highlighted. Still, the same behavior applies.

:VIP:

   Like :doc:`ticket priority </basics/service-ticket/settings/priority>`,
   **VIP status** doesn't actually do anything out-of-the-box,
   but an admin *can* set up automated system hooks based on this value,
   or use it as a filter for :doc:`custom overviews </basics/find-ticket/browse>`.

   **Ask your administrator** about how she'd like you to use this attribute
   (or just leave it alone).
