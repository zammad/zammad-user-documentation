Organizations
=============

Tickets track communication between individuals, but oftentimes,
your company’s real client is **another company** (or **organization**).
Customers can be grouped into organizations
to monitor their activity as a whole.

Organization Profiles

Use the **ticket pane** to manage organization profiles.

Organization Stats

With organizations, you can answer questions like:

* “How many tickets has this company had to file in the last 12 months?”
* “How many tickets does this company have open right now?”
* “How old is the oldest open ticket from this company?”
