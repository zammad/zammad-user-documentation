Checklist
=========

General
-------

Use a checklist in tickets to keep track of the tasks to be completed. You can
find the checklist feature in the right sidebar in the "Checklist" tab (unless
your admin has deactivated it). Please note that you can only add or edit a
checklist, if you have the permission to edit the ticket.

Usage
-----

If you want to add a checklist to a ticket, go to the "Checklist" tab and click
either on "Add empty checklist" (1) or "Add from template" (2) after selecting
a template. If you can't see the the "Add from template" area, there is no
template available.

Depending on your choice, you can create your own new checklist or use a
predefined template. In both cases, you can:

- Edit the checklist title
- Edit the checklist items (reorder, rename, add, delete)
- Remove the complete checklist
- Add a checklist, if there is no existing one

You can perform most of these edit, add and delete actions on different ways:

- Click on the item text (checklist title or checklist item) to edit it
- Click on the checkbox to check an item
- Click on the ︙ or on the "Checklist" title to select actions from the menu
- To add an item, click on the "+ Add" button
- To reorder them, use the corresponding button. You can then drag & drop the
  items via the ≣ handle.
