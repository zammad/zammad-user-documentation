   Enable the **Phone** panel to receive notifications for incoming calls.

.. note:: **🤔 Huh? I don’t see “Phone” in the menu...** 

   This feature is **optional**;
   if you don’t see it in the main menu,
   that means your administrator hasn’t enabled it yet.
   Administrators can learn more
   `here <https://admin-docs.zammad.org/en/latest/system-integrations.html#integrations-for-phone-systems>`_.

.. hint::
   🏢 The caller log shows all incoming and outgoing calls **for the entire team**.

.. tip::

   👤 Click on unrecognized numbers in the caller log to **create a new
   customer and ticket**. (Unrecognized phone numbers cannot be added to
   existing customers in this way.)
