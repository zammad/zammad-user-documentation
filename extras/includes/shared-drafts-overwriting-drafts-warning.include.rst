.. warning:: **☠️ Overwriting drafts is final**

   Zammad will warn you in case you're going to overwrite an existing draft.
   This also applies to your personal draft in case you're loading a
   shared draft.

   Loading a shared draft, (adjusting and) updating the ticket with an
   article will cause Zammad to *remove* the shared draft.

   This also applies if you're sharing the draft before submitting!
   Zammad expects that the draft is no longer needed.
